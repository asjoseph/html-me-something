    <h1>Cray</h1>
        <p>Might as well describe my current crazy life.<br>
        I came home on Sunday night to find my dad packing<br> 
        two shipping crates on the back on our Ram.<br> 
        Per usual I pay him no attention and head to my room<br> 
        and turn off the lights.</p> 
    <h1>Crow</h1>
        <p>Fast forward it's 5:30am and I hear them...<br> 
        footsteps heading towardss my room.<br>
        He wants me to drive him to Riviera beach<br> 
        to drop off a shipment for my sisters baby store.<br> 
        Team no sleep as usual.<br>
        Jacket... boots... door... ignition<br>
        Me= Driver, Dad= Knocked Out!<br> 
        Hours later I'm unloading the truck and signing papers.</p> 
    <h1>Hustle</h1>
        <p>Back to Tampa, just in time to get ready for work.<br>
        Shower... dress... drive... desk... drive... desk... bed.</p>

    <h1>&amp; Hustle</h1>
        <p>Alarm. What?! Uh. Why?!<br>
        It's time to head to work again. Shower... drive... desk... boss.<br>
        "You want me to go where?", "Ocala", "Uh... okay"<br>
        Me= Passenger, Boss= Driver, but why? <br>
        hours later... Ocala. <br>
        Talk, talk, talk.<br>
        The Egg and I<br>
        Me= Passenger, Boss= Driver, but why?!<br>
        Tampa.<br>
        Can I please leave early? Yes!</p>
    
    <h1>Life</h1>    
        <p>Home... study... shower... drive... lc101<br>
        Huh?!? Oh... Cool... Huh?!... Wait... Got it!<br>
        Drive... gym... drive... home... sleep!</p>
