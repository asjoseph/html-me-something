    <h1>Cray</h1>
        <p>Might as well describe my current crazy life.
        I came home on Sunday night to find my dad packing 
        two shipping crates on the back on our Ram. 
        Per usual I pay him no attention and head to my room 
        and turn off the lights.</p> 
    <h1>Crow</h1>
        <p>Fast forward it's 5:30am and I hear them... 
        footsteps heading towardss my room.
        He wants me to drive him to Riviera beach 
        to drop off a shipment for my sisters baby store. 
        Team no sleep as usual.
        Jacket... boots... door... ignition
        Me= Driver, Dad= Knocked Out! 
        Hours later I'm unloading the truck and signing papers.</p> 
    <h1>Hustle</h1>
        <p>Back to Tampa, just in time to get ready for work.
        Shower... dress... drive... desk... drive... desk... bed.</p>

    <h1>&amp; Hustle</h1>
        <p>Alarm. What?! Uh. Why?!
        It's time to head to work again. Shower... drive... desk... boss.
        "You want me to go where?", "Ocala", "Uh... okay"
        Me= Passenger, Boss= Driver, but why? 
        hours later... Ocala. 
        Talk, talk, talk.
        The Egg and I
        Me= Passenger, Boss= Driver, but why?!
        Tampa.
        Can I please leave early? Yes!</p>
    
    <h1>Life</h1>    
        <p>Home... study... shower... drive... lc101
        Huh?!? Oh... Cool... Huh?!... Wait... Got it!
        Drive... gym... drive... home... sleep!</p>
